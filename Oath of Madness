You can see and sense the thoughts of all creatures within 60 ft.
You may make melee attacks from anywhere within 30 ft. of your actual position.
As an attack or a bonus action, you may attempt to grapple a target within 30 ft. of you. If you succeed, you may move the target to any location within 30 ft. using your movement speed. This grapple does not reduce your movement speed.
